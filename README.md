# Thoth

Thoth is a local-first task control plane for AI work. It turns a compact user intent into a
clarified, recoverable and reviewable task while keeping provider execution inside configured
Agent Harness sessions.

## MVP Beta

The automated MVP beta channel is fixed at
[`v0.0.0-mvp-beta`](https://github.com/SeeleAI/Thoth/releases/tag/v0.0.0-mvp-beta). The release
contains unsigned desktop packages for macOS, Windows and Linux, a signed universal Android APK,
and a server CLI bundle.

Install the server CLI directly from the GitHub Release with Node.js `24.14.0` or newer:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/SeeleAI/Thoth/releases/download/v0.0.0-mvp-beta/thoth-server-cli-0.0.0-mvp-beta.tgz
```

The server CLI is not published to the npm registry. Desktop packages are unsigned in this MVP:
macOS may show a Gatekeeper warning and Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. The Android APK is
signed with a dedicated Thoth MVP beta key so future replacements remain upgrade-compatible.

Fresh MVP installs use the Relay v3 test service at `relay.test.thoth.seeles.ai:443` over TLS.

## What Thoth Is For

Thoth is designed to reduce the user’s cognitive burden and entry barrier. The user should be able to describe intent naturally; Thoth should clarify only the few decisions that matter, register durable tasks when needed, run asynchronous loops, review results adversarially, and report with evidence.

The core product direction is:

1. One Thoth, not a visible agent dashboard.
2. UI shells are replaceable; authority belongs to Thoth.
3. Tasks are recoverable, reviewable, asynchronous loops.
4. Success is based on acceptance and evidence, not executor self-report.
5. Harnesses such as Claude Code, Codex, ACP-compatible tools, and future providers are adapters, not the source of truth.

The root `package.json` is the canonical command surface. See [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md),
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md), [`docs/packaging.md`](docs/packaging.md) and
[`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md) before changing runtime, packaging or release behavior.
