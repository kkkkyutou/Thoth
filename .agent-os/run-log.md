# Run Log

## 2026-06-28 [New Thoth repo reset]

- Worked on: `NTH-OBJ-001`, `NTH-MS-001`, `NTH-TD-001`
- State changes: Reset the active branch toward New Thoth by removing the old Python / Claude-Codex plugin runtime from the active working tree and replacing the public entrypoints with New Thoth documentation and monorepo skeleton metadata.
- State changes: Rewrote project recovery documents around New Thoth IDs and current truth. Old plugin history is now referenced through release `thoth-plugin-final-archive` and branch `archive/main-20260627`.
- State changes: Added the prompt seed extraction document so old prompt lessons survive as contracts rather than legacy Python code.
- Evidence produced: Old runtime path check confirmed `thoth`, `scripts`, `templates`, `tests`, `commands`, `plugins`, `.claude-plugin`, `.codex-plugin`, `.agents`, `bin`, `pyproject.toml`, `.pytest_cache`, `.tmp_pytest` and `research.db` are gone from the repo root. Package metadata check reported `package metadata ok 11`; package directory count reported `10`; design document check reported `design docs ok`; `CLAUDE.md` symlink check reported `CLAUDE symlink ok`; asset check confirmed only `thoth-icon.svg` and `thoth.png` remain; `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` completed with `found 0 vulnerabilities`; `git diff --check` passed. Old `.tmp_pytest` cleanup hit NFS unlink stalls; remaining untracked residue was moved under ignored `.agent-os/.trash/tmp_pytest-nfs-stale-20260628` so the repo root no longer exposes the old test-cache path.
- Next likely action: `NTH-TD-002` - design the first implementation slice for Router, Clarify, authority store and task lifecycle.

## 2026-06-29 [AGENTS engineering behavior integration]

- Worked on: `NTH-OBJ-001`, `NTH-WS-001`
- State changes: Integrated the engineering behavior rules from `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` `CLAUDE.md` into root `AGENTS.md` as New Thoth scoped guidance: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes and Goal-Driven Execution.
- Evidence produced: `git diff --check` passed. Targeted scan confirmed `AGENTS.md` now contains `通用工程行为准则`, `Think Before Coding`, `Simplicity First`, `Surgical Changes`, `Goal-Driven Execution` and the `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` source note.
- Next likely action: `NTH-TD-002` - design the first implementation slice for Router, Clarify, authority store and task lifecycle.
