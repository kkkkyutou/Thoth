# $thoth auto

Generated micro prompt for the Thoth Codex dispatcher.

## Route

- route_class: `live_intelligent`
- intelligence_tier: `high`
- packet_authority_mode: `phase_controller`

## Objective

Run actionable work items by scheduling priority through child loops until none remain, budget pauses, or stop is requested.

## Hard Stops

- Do not execute blocked or draft work.
- Do not auto-abandon work items.
- Do not bypass execution-safety doctor preflight.

## Reply Contract

- reply_budget_utf8: `120`
- result_style: start or reuse the durable controller, then stream JSONL watch events until terminal or observer interruption
- validator_policy: controller cursor, child loop results, and auto watch events define queue state

## Execution String

Operate only on this repo. Use the installed skill named thoth. The Codex public surface is `$thoth auto`, but in the workspace shell you must execute it literally as `bash -lc 'set -euo pipefail; if [ -n "${THOTH_SELFTEST_RUNTIME_ROOT:-}" ]; then if [ -x "$THOTH_SELFTEST_RUNTIME_ROOT/bin/thoth" ]; then exec "$THOTH_SELFTEST_RUNTIME_ROOT/bin/thoth" "$@"; fi; if [ -f "$THOTH_SELFTEST_RUNTIME_ROOT/scripts/thoth-cli-entry.py" ]; then exec python3 "$THOTH_SELFTEST_RUNTIME_ROOT/scripts/thoth-cli-entry.py" "$@"; fi; fi; if command -v thoth >/dev/null 2>&1; then exec thoth "$@"; fi; candidates="$(ls -td "$HOME"/.codex/plugins/cache/thoth/thoth/* "$HOME"/.codex/plugins/cache/thoth/* "$HOME"/.codex/plugins/cache/*/thoth/* "$HOME"/.codex/plugins/cache/*/Thoth/* 2>/dev/null || true)"; marketplace="$HOME/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/thoth"; if [ -d "$marketplace" ]; then candidates="$candidates
$marketplace"; fi; for candidate in $candidates; do if [ -x "$candidate/bin/thoth" ]; then exec "$candidate/bin/thoth" "$@"; fi; if [ -f "$candidate/scripts/thoth-cli-entry.py" ]; then if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then exec python3 "$candidate/scripts/thoth-cli-entry.py" "$@"; else exec python "$candidate/scripts/thoth-cli-entry.py" "$@"; fi; fi; done; echo '"'"'thoth installed runtime not found'"'"' >&2; exit 127' thoth auto`. Execute that shell command immediately as your first meaningful action. Do not explain the command before executing it. Do not replace execution with prose. If neither PATH nor the installed Codex plugin cache or marketplace root contains the runtime entrypoint, report host install drift instead of inventing another entrypoint. route_class=live_intelligent. intelligence_tier=high. packet_authority_mode=phase_controller. Objective: Run actionable work items by scheduling priority through child loops until none remain, budget pauses, or stop is requested. Hard stop: Do not execute blocked or draft work. Hard stop: Do not auto-abandon work items. Hard stop: Do not bypass execution-safety doctor preflight. If the command streams runtime events, report progress and risks from those events only. Stay in the same session until the RuntimeDriver reaches terminal state unless --sleep was requested. Runtime lifecycle is plan -> execute -> validate -> reflect; auto advances selected work through child loops. Do not hand-edit `.thoth`; let the Thoth runtime driver advance phases. Reply with `THOTH_DONE` only after the command path reaches its terminal outcome.
