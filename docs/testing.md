# Testing

Tests prove behavior, not implementation shape. The default gate for Thoth development is the foundation gate.

## Foundation Gate

Foundation packages:

- `packages/app/highlight`
- `packages/relay`
- `packages/protocol`
- `packages/client`

Run:

```bash
npm run check:foundation
```

This expands to repository validation, format check, foundation lint, foundation build, foundation typecheck and foundation tests.

If this gate fails, fix it before starting or continuing product feature work.

## Narrow Iteration

Use narrow checks while iterating:

```bash
npm run test:protocol
npm run test:client
npm run test:relay
npm run test:highlight
npm run typecheck:protocol
npm run typecheck:client
```

## Fast Thoth Product API Acceptance

The smallest non-negotiable product acceptance is one public-API journey against the daemon bundled
inside the final AppImage:

```bash
npm run accept:thoth:api -- --appimage packages/desktop/release/Thoth-x86_64.AppImage
```

The journey is intentionally a single behavior chain rather than a list of implementation tests:

```text
raw -> Quick Clarify -> raw -> Loop -> Review fail -> retry -> pass -> done
```

It proves that one visible Agent keeps the same provider session while Thoth is hot-switched, Agent
Cards use the public CAS authority API, Quick completes in the foreground, Loop registration ends the
foreground lifecycle at `background_handoff`, and independent PlanExec/Review sessions consume one
failed-Review retry before the task reaches `done`. The packaged smoke also inspects `app.asar`, mounts
the packaged Clarify/Loop skills, and uses the daemon managed by the AppImage rather than repository
daemon code.

The default external scripted harness controls only provider transport actions. It must call the real
runtime tools and cannot write daemon state directly. This keeps the result deterministic and normally
under one minute. The same `ThothApiJourney` can run against real Codex without changing product steps:

```bash
npm run accept:thoth:api -- \
  --real-codex \
  --quick-prompt-file .dev/acceptance/quick.txt \
  --loop-prompt-file .dev/acceptance/loop.txt
```

`scripts/acceptance/thoth-api-journey.mjs` owns product actions and assertions. Environment launchers
own only process/container/Relay setup, while provider fixtures own only harness transport. Optional
Pause/Resume/Stop, restart, UI and Relay checks compose after `runCore()`; they must not duplicate the
Clarify/Quick/Loop chain. A stale or previously published AppImage can validate itself but does not
validate newer source changes, so rebuild the AppImage before using this command as release evidence.

## Source-Level Product API Checks

Use the public Create/Send/Card/Background Task API suite while changing the foreground coordinator or authority
store:

```bash
npm run test:thoth-foreground
```

The suite covers raw passthrough, same-session hot switching, Agent-scoped Card authority, cancellation,
restart/recovery and Loop registration. It is a fast source check, not packaged acceptance.

Provider transport fixtures live outside the Journey and may prescribe semantic tool calls. They must still use
the real provider adapter and runtime-tool handlers; they may not insert Cards, tasks, phases or verdicts into
authority storage.

## Acceptance Layers

Use the cheapest layer that can disprove the current change, then promote the same Journey:

1. `Source API`: public daemon/client API with an in-process provider adapter.
2. `Packaged API`: AppImage-managed daemon with the external scripted harness. This is the default product gate.
3. `Real provider`: the same packaged Journey with real Codex dynamic tools.
4. `Environment extensions`: UI, Relay, Pause/Resume/Stop and daemon/app restart composed around `runCore()`.
5. `Release`: clean native jobs and a repeat run against assets downloaded from the public Release.

Claude Code, OpenCode and ACP must use the same Journey through their adapter capability contracts. Until an
adapter supports session-scoped skills, semantic tools, turn identity and continuation, Thoth-on acceptance must
report honest unsupported rather than use a provider-specific fallback.

## Runtime Isolation

When touching daemon, CLI host resolution, app host bootstrap, desktop daemon lifecycle, Relay pairing or
packaging paths, also run:

```bash
npm run smoke:isolation
```

This smoke proves the reserved legacy service remains on `127.0.0.1:6767` while Thoth uses its own runtime. It
must never probe, stop, reuse or restart the legacy daemon.

## Release Gates

The fast Journey is necessary but does not replace broad promotion evidence. Before replacing the MVP Release,
run the affected package suites, `npm run check:foundation`, daemon/web builds, three golden judges, native
desktop/Android/CLI smokes, real Relay, secret scan and `git diff --check`. The workflow must then repeat the
packaged Journey before publishing and rerun it against the downloaded public AppImage.

## Test Suffixes

- `*.test.ts(x)`: deterministic unit tests.
- `*.posix.test.ts`: POSIX-only unit tests.
- `*.browser.test.ts`: browser-backed app tests.
- `*.e2e.test.ts`: local end-to-end tests against real local services.
- `*.real.e2e.test.ts`: tests that hit real providers or external services.
- `*.local.e2e.test.ts`: tests that require local-only resources.

Real provider tests are opt-in. They must never be part of `check:foundation`.

## Rules

1. Prefer deterministic assertions over weak assertions.
2. No conditional assertions in tests.
3. Do not delete flaky tests; fix the variance source.
4. Do not add fake auth checks for providers.
5. Boundary JSON and protocol messages should be schema-validated.
6. Do not claim a check passed unless the command was actually run in the current work session.
